        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Mike Moriarty and I am an Information Management and Technology major with a concentration in Network and Cloud Computing. I really enjoy creating and managing computer networks, and am excited to start a career in that field.

            I am a US Army veteran who worked for six and a half years as an active duty IT specialist. My most recent position was working on the Executive Communications Team for the XVIII Airborne Corps as the Commanding General’s personal communications attaché. IT certifications I have completed include Security+, ICND 1 & 2, and A+.
