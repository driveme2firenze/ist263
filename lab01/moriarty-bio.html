    </head>

    <body>
        My name is Mike Moriarty and I am an Information Management and Technology major with a concentration in Network and Cloud Computing. I really enjoy creating and managing computer networks, and am excited to start a career in that field. I am a US Army veteran who worked for six and a half years as an active duty IT specialist. My most recent position was working on the Executive Communications Team for the XVIII Airborne Corps as the Commanding General’s personal communications attaché. IT certifications I have completed include Security+, ICND 1 & 2, and A+. Outside of IT, my interests span over a great many things (maybe too many things). I am an avid music lover, especially of the band Phish, who I have seen perform 18 times and will continue to bump those numbers up as the years go on. I also love playing guitar, playing video games, reading (both fiction and non-fiction), watching movies and TV shows, cycling, weight training, kayaking, camping, hiking, amateur astronomy, traveling abroad, political debate and discussion, long car trips, and cooking (just to name a few things).
